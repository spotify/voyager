# How to Contribute

We'd love to get patches from you!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile Voyager from scratch, the following packages will need to be installed:

- [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher.
- A C++ compiler, e.g. `gcc`, `clang`, etc.

### Building Voyager

```shell
git clone git@github.com:spotify/voyager.git
cd voyager
pip3 install -r python/dev-requirements.txt
pip3 install .
```

To compile a debug build of `voyager` that allows using a debugger (like gdb or lldb), use the following command to build the package locally and install a symbolic link for debugging:
```shell
cd python
DEBUG=1 python3 setup.py build develop
```

Then, you can `import voyager` from Python (or run the tests with `tox`) to test out your local changes.

> If you're on macOS or Linux, you can try to compile a debug build _faster_ by using [Ccache](https://ccache.dev/):
> ## macOS
> ```shell
> brew install ccache
> rm -rf build && CC="ccache clang" CXX="ccache clang++" DEBUG=1 python3 -j8 -m pip install -e .
> ```
> ## Linux
> e.g.
> ```shell
> sudo yum install ccache  # or apt, if on a Debian
> 
> # If using GCC:
> rm -rf build && CC="ccache gcc" CXX="scripts/ccache_g++" DEBUG=1 python3 setup.py build -j8 develop
> 
> # ...or if using Clang:
> rm -rf build && CC="ccache clang" CXX="scripts/ccache_clang++" DEBUG=1 python3 setup.py build -j8 develop
> ```

### Updating Documentation
If you notice that the documentation is out of date, feel free to run these commands in order to update the docs and make a PR with the changes.

#### Python
While `voyager` is mostly C++ code, it ships with `.pyi` files to allow for type hints in text editors and via MyPy. To update the Python type hint files, use the following commands:

```shell
cd python
python3 -m scripts.generate_type_stubs_and_docs
# Documentation will be dumped into ../docs/python/
```

#### Java
To update the javadocs for the java bindings, you can simply run:

```shell
cd java
mvn package
```

this will update the java documentation located in [docs/java/](https://github.com/spotify/voyager/tree/main/docs/java).

## Workflow

We follow the [GitHub Flow Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/):

1.  Fork the project 
1.  Check out the `master` branch 
1.  Create a feature branch
1.  Write code and tests for your change 
1.  From your branch, make a pull request against `https://github.com/spotify/voyager` 
1.  Work with repo maintainers to get your change reviewed 
1.  Wait for your change to be pulled into `https://github.com/spotify/voyager/master`
1.  Delete your feature branch

## Testing

We use `tox` for testing - running tests from end-to-end should be as simple as:

```
pip3 install tox
tox
```

## Style

Use [`clang-format`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) for C++ code, and `black` with defaults for Python code.

In order to check and run formatting within the python module, you can use tox to facilitate this.
```bash
cd python
# Check formatting only (don't change files)
tox -e check-formatting
# Run formatter for python bindings and native python code
tox -e format
```

## Issues

When creating an issue please try to ahere to the following format:

    One line summary of the issue (less than 72 characters)

    ### Expected behaviour

    As concisely as possible, describe the expected behaviour.

    ### Actual behaviour

    As concisely as possible, describe the observed behaviour.

    ### Steps to reproduce the behaviour

    List all relevant steps to reproduce the observed behaviour.

## Pull Requests

Files should be exempt of trailing spaces.

We adhere to a specific format for commit messages. Please write your commit
messages along these guidelines. Please keep the line width no greater than 80
columns (You can use `fmt -n -p -w 80` to accomplish this).

    One line description of your change (less than 72 characters)

    Problem

    Explain the context and why you're making that change.  What is the problem
    you're trying to solve? In some cases there is not a problem and this can be
    thought of being the motivation for your change.

    Solution

    Describe the modifications you've done.

    Result

    What will change as a result of your pull request? Note that sometimes this
    section is unnecessary because it is self-explanatory based on the solution.

Some important notes regarding the summary line:

* Describe what was done; not the result 
* Use the active voice 
* Use the present tense 
* Capitalize properly 
* Do not end in a period â€” this is a title/subject 
* Prefix the subject with its scope

## Documentation

We also welcome improvements to the project documentation or to the existing
docs. Please file an [issue](https://github.com/spotify/voyager/issues/new).

## First Contributions

If you are a first time contributor to `voyager`,  familiarize yourself with the:
* [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* [GitHub Flow Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
<!-- * Issue and pull request style guides -->

When you're ready, navigate to [issues](https://github.com/spotify/voyager/issues/new). Some issues have been identified by community members as [good first issues](https://github.com/spotify/voyager/labels/good%20first%20issue). 

There is a lot to learn when making your first contribution. As you gain experience, you will be able to make contributions faster. You can submit an issue using the [question](https://github.com/spotify/voyager/labels/question) label if you encounter challenges.

# Troubleshooting

## Building the project

### `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pybind11'`

Try updating your version of `pip`:
```shell
pip install --upgrade pip
```

### `Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -2] Name or service not known'`
You may have networking issues. Check to make sure you do not have the `PIP_INDEX_URL` environment variable set (or that it points to a valid index).

### `fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory`
Ensure you have the Python development packages installed.
You will need to find correct package for your operating system. (i.e.: `python-dev`, `python-devel`, etc.)

### `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'`
- Ensure that you have Tox version 4 or greater installed
- _or_ set `ignore_basepython_conflict=true` in `tox.ini`
- _or_ install Tox using `pip` and not your system package manager
