class Index:
    """
    A nearest-neighbor search index containing vector data (i.e. lists of
    floating-point values, each list labeled with a single integer ID).

    Think of a Voyager :py:class:`Index` as a ``Dict[int, List[float]]``
    (a dictionary mapping integers to lists of floats), where a
    :py:meth:`query` method allows finding the *k* nearest ``int`` keys
    to a provided ``List[float]`` query vector.

    .. warning::
        Voyager is an **approximate** nearest neighbor index package, which means
        that each call to the :py:meth:`query` method may return results that
        are *approximately* correct. The metric used to gauge the accuracy
        of a Voyager :py:meth:`query` is called
        `recall <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall>`_. Recall
        measures the percentage of correct results returned per
        :py:meth:`query`.

        Various parameters documented below (like ``M``, ``ef_construction``,
        and ``ef``) may affect the recall of queries. Usually, increasing recall
        requires either increasing query latency, increasing memory usage,
        increasing index creation time, or all of the above.


    Voyager indices support insertion, lookup, and deletion of vectors.

    Calling the :py:class:`Index` constructor will return an object of one
    of three classes:

    - :py:class:`FloatIndex`, which uses 32-bit precision for all data
    - :py:class:`Float8Index`, which uses 8-bit fixed-point precision and requires all vectors to be within the bounds [-1, 1]
    - :py:class:`E4M3Index`, which uses 8-bit floating-point precision and requires all vectors to be within the bounds [-448, 448]

    Args:
        space:
            The :py:class:`Space` to use to calculate the distance between vectors,
            :py:class:`Space.Cosine` (cosine distance).

            The choice of distance to use usually depends on the kind of vector
            data being inserted into the index. If your vectors are usually compared
            by measuring the cosine distance between them, use :py:class:`Space.Cosine`.

        num_dimensions:
            The number of dimensions present in each vector added to this index.
            Each vector in the index must have the same number of dimensions.

        M:
            The number of connections between nodes in the tree's internal data structure.
            Larger values give better recall, but use more memory. This parameter cannot
            be changed after the index is instantiated.

        ef_construction:
            The number of vectors to search through when inserting a new vector into
            the index. Higher values make index construction slower, but give better
            recall. This parameter cannot be changed after the index is instantiated.

        random_seed:
            The seed (initial value) of the random number generator used when
            constructing this index. Byte-for-byte identical indices can be created
            by setting this value to a known value and adding vectors to the index
            one-at-a-time (to avoid nondeterministic ordering due to multi-threaded
            insertion).

        max_elements:
            The maximum size of the index at construction time. Indices can be resized
            (and are automatically resized when :py:meth:`add_item` or
            :py:meth:`add_items` is called) so this value is only useful if the exact
            number of elements that will be added to this index is known in advance.
